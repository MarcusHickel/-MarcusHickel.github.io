          <p> My Internship overseas in Austria at SIEMENS mobility allowed me to explore my career as a mechanical engineer for the testing Team I mainly focused on the testing rig, 
            developing new configurations and designing a new standard set of arm to transfer forces to the test pieces. 
            I made good use of my experience with MATLab and used my skills in Solidworks to help me use CREO PTC.

          On top of all the technical experience I learned I also was able to practice communication in German, (even though sometimes it was difficult understanding their dialect). 
          Overall, it was a great internship and Iâ€™d like to thank my co-workers for an awesome experience!
