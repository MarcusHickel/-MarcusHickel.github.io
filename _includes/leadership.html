        I was the Team Lead of the UTS Rocketry Team for 2023.
        The role of the Team lead is to drive the mission of the Team and up keep its values and spirit. I had organised 16 rocket launches for the Team. 4 of them being university field trips to high power launch sites.
        I had optimised the way the team organises, launches, and documents our rocket launches.
        Mostly I had learned how to manage individuals with their want and needs to guide them with the views of the Team.
        I had leaned conflict resolution and being able to adapt when plans don't go as intended. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I had learned so much in this role. I really thank my Team for such an amazing year. We accomplished so much, from launching our largest rocket Unity. 
        Competing in our first international competition (Spaceport America Cup) and beginning our first steps into hybrid rocketry.

        I was the 2022 Mechanical Lead for the UTS Rocketry Team.
        In this role I've been developed a course to teach new trainees about the basics of rocketry and how to build their first low powered rocket. 
        All the way from design to manufacturing and construction. My other duties had me overseeing and organising the mechanical projects the Team works on. 
        Such as the team rocket Unity! I've been delegating tasks to members based on their strengths and their interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed this role because it allowed me to help expand the capabilities of the team while also ensuring its longevity via teaching.
        The best part is seeing the enthusiasm that new members bring and matching the energy I have when talking about rockets!
