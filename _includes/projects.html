    <h3> Project Unity </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Height: 3m</li>
      <li> Diameter: 158mm </li>
      <li> Motor: Aerotech K650</li>
      <li> Altitude: 3000ft/1km </li>
      <li> Mechanical Lead for Unity Project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Goal for the Unity project was to develop a process of project management for future competition rockets.
      Initially the rocket was meant to be a kit to just focus to have less focus on the design aspect. 
      However do to supply chain issues, the kit was not available so the we decided to change the objective.
      This lead to the aims being changed to a full CAD design of the rocket with AS1100 engineering drawings in Solidworks.
      With which I had developed a method of keeping track of manufacturing and suppliers using Microsoft Excel, 
      getting multiple team members experience in construction of a Team Rocket.
      Project Unity flew April of 2023 and had a successful flight and recovery.

    <h3> Fibre Optic Embedded Airframes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Leading and allocating tasks </li>
      <li> Thrust profile analysis</li>
      <li> Finite Element analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This project we worked on modelling the stresses experienced during flight of rocket bodies. We designed a layout for 
      fibre optic sensors to be used on the rocket. Due to COVID we were not able to perform physical tests, however the project had 
      some interesting challenges. For example, I needed a thrust profile for the FEA, however there was no detailed one available. 
      I was able to create a thrust profile by extracting the sound from the launch video and made a composite with the thrust curve from online sources.

    <h3> Warman Competition </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Leadership </li>
      <li> Design and construction of a Robot</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Warman project saw me with a group of students design and build a robot that would pick up and move balls to a designated area.
      I mainly worked on the mechanical side, creating the crane and winch system and well as the base of the robot.
      While we never fully accomplished the goal (The robot could pick up the balls and move them). The process of doing so was enjoyable,
      and I learned a lot about leading a group.

    <h3> Water Pump Project </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Design and Drawing </li>
      <li> Use of basic handtools</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The hand tools project was a hand powered suction pump designed to turn human power into
      mechanical energy to pull water from underground sources. Made from PVC piping, valves, and a piston rod,
      it was able a achieve 2.225L/min flow rate at an estimated 60% efficiency.

      I mainly take photos with my DLSR whenever I get the chance to be under dark skies.
      With the addition of a 1200mm, 254mm Dobsonian I've been able to peer into the vast expanse of space. 
      And I plan to make some alterations to improve its ability to take photos of distant nebule.
